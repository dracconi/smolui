# Functions
draw_bmp's first argument is 1-dim byte array.
Bitmap width has to be byte-aligned.
Individual byte represents 8 pixels laying in a vertical line.
MSB is leftmost, LSB is rightmost.

There is a problem made to avoid divisions (but there's modulo op. already, so
maybe I should forget about that...). Width argument `w` takes a number of
`pixels/8` (number of bytes).

# Converting
In order to load bitmaps, one has to convert png to pbm and then strip the
header off (P4...height<whitespace>). Then, `xxd -i` can be used to get the file
in a C array initializer.

# Atlases
Conventional way of combining multiple bitmaps into one array (an atlas) is done
by aligning individual images in a unit width column:

+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 2 |
+---+
| 3 |
+---+

Data is then accessed by offsetting the array. Widths are constant.
